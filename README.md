this is a cisco packet tracer (cpt) lab file which has been configured using static route
it contains a text file containing the various commands used
it was designed by m for educational purposes for those who wish to understand how static routing works
pc1 can communicate with pc2 but R1 and R2 doesn't seem to communicate, any suggestions and modifications will be of great help
